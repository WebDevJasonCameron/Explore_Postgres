# Explore_Postgres

## Purpose
Hello everyone.  I know I've got a lot of repos. Most of them are just me exploring some-kind-of tech.  I learn best through experience.  That's why I've got so many of these.  I also forget alot of what I learn because I'm constantly trying to juggle way too much.  That's also why I have so many of these.  GH give me the opportunity to search for those lessons I've worked on and remember/refresh my understanding.  It also lets me show growth in those things.  As such, I'm taking my knowledge of PG to a deeper level of understanding and this repo reflects my journey.  It will probably be a short one since I want to apply to to several of my other projects ASAP.
