-- CROSS JOIN
-- ####################

-- * Resulsts (also known as a Cartesian product) lines up each row in the left table
-- with each row in the right table to poresent all possible combination of rows

-- * If table1 has n rows and table2 has m rows, the result set will be
-- n * m rows

-- * Unlike INNER JOIN, LEFT / RIGHT JOIN, CROSS JOIN does not have a join predicate
