-- 1. Order of execution with AND, OR operators

-- AND is porcessed first and the OR is processed second

-- SQL processes the AND operator link MULTIPLICATION nd the 0R like ADDITION
-- unless you include parentheses

-- Without parentheses, the AND will be processed in the same way that 3+2+1 would equal 7,
-- but 3*(2+1) would equal 9

-- It is better to just use parentheses whenever you are using multiple operators so that it is clear
